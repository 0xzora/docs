# ðŸŒˆ Hyper Oracle

<img src=".gitbook/assets/hoLogoNoBG.png" alt="" data-size="line">Hyper Oracle is a programmable zkOracle protocol that safeguards blockchain security and decentralization.

From indexing to smart contract automation, Hyper Oracleâ€™s zkGraph standards (meta apps) make onchain data and onchain-equivalent computation useful and verifiable with fast finality. Hyper Oracle empowers developers to interact with blockchain in new ways.

Hyper Oracle replaces traditional oracle and middleware infrastructure's security and incentive mechanisms from staking to ZKP.
