# zkML

Machine learning and AI related computation will lead the next era of innovation and application. To enable decentralized machine learning computation by making its inference process on-chain, we need zkML to enable [model privacy, user input privacy, and model computation integrity](https://www.canva.com/design/DAFgqqAboU0/4HscC5E3YkFRFk3bB64chw/view#6).&#x20;

zkML is Hyper Oracle's trustless machine learning inference protocol based on zero knowledge proofs. zkML is a zkAutomation-like input and output zkOracle Meta App that integrates zk machine learning frameworks and stacks ([EZKL](https://github.com/zkonduit/ezkl), [Remainder](https://www.moduluslabs.xyz/), [circomlib-ml](https://github.com/socathie/circomlib-ml)), using zkGraph as the core component to enable on-chain ML inference. Developers can use zkML to build any decentralized application driven by ML and secured by Ethereum.
