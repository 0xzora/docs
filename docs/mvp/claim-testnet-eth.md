# Claim Testnet ETH

Before any testing, we need to top up ETH into our wallet address on testnet first.

### Prerequisites

* Ethereum-compatible Web Wallet (Currently, MetaMask only)
* ETH address

### Claiming Test Tokens from Faucet

{% hint style="info" %}
In this example, we will use Goerli as our testnet.

#### 1. [Goerli PoW Faucet](https://goerli-faucet.pk910.de/)

#### [https://goerli-faucet.pk910.de/](https://goerli-faucet.pk910.de/)

On the faucet page, paste your Goerli ETH address into the input box, complete the verification, and click `Start Mining`. The web page will start to "mine" ETH in a PoW-like manner (this is to prevent spam). After running this for a while, you can claim the ETH.

#### 2. [Alchemy Goerli Faucet](https://goerlifaucet.com/)

#### [https://goerlifaucet.com/](https://goerlifaucet.com/)

On the faucet page, paste your Goerli ETH address into the input box, connect your Alchemy account, complete the verification, and click `Send Me ETH`. You should be receiving ETH after the transaction is processed.

In addition to these two faucets, you can also use other ways to get ETH on testnet. The basic requirement is to have at least a certain amount of ETH.
