# zkGraph

zkGraph defines the off-chain computation of Hyper Oracle nodes, including data-related behaviors and zk proof generation, much like how smart contracts define the EVM computation of Ethereum nodes.

Smart contract developers can build both the smart contract and the zkGraph. Users can then interact with both.

To utilize the infrastructure of Hyper Oracle Meta Apps, developers must configure and code their zkGraph to specify how they want the data to be handled. The Hyper Oracle nodes then process the data and generate a zk proof based on the specified definitions.
