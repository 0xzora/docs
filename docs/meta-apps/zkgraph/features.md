### **Subgraph-Equivalence**

zkGraph is equivalent to The Graph's Subgraph.

Migrating existing Subgraphs to zkGraph requires just 10 lines of configuration difference. Implementations such as [Standardized Subgraph](https://github.com/messari/subgraphs) and ecosystem tooling like [Instant Subgraph](https://docs.goldsky.com/indexing/instant-subgraphs) and [Subgraph Uncrashable](https://thegraph.academy/developers/subgraph-uncrashable/) can be used for developing zkGraph.
