### Methods for Development

For the development of zkGraph, we offer two development methods:

1. zkGraph Studio on Web UI: Easy-to-use integrated web code editor and interface for zkGraph development.
2. zkGraph Template Locally: More customizable and end-to-end local scaffold for zkGraph development.
