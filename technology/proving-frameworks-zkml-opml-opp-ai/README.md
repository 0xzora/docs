# Proving Frameworks (zkML, opML, opp/ai)

To establish a verifiable and decentralized oracle network, it's critical to ensure the computation validity of results on the blockchain. This process involves a proof system that ensures the computation is reliable and truthful. By doing so, we can enhance the integrity and trustworthiness of decentralized applications that rely on any-size compute, including AI inference.

Several technologies invented and developed by ORA have emerged to facilitate the verifiable computation including AI inference on the blockchain. These innovations include Optimistic Machine Learning (opML), Keras2Circom (Zero-Knowledge Machine Learning, zkML), and Optimistic Privacy Preserving AI (opp/ai), with each representing a significant stride towards integrating verifiable proofs into the blockchain.
