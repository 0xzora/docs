# How ORA Works

ORA provides developers with the tools necessary to build end-to-end trustless and decentralized applications empowered by Artificial Intelligence.

ORA's two main offerings are:

* [**Onchain AI Oracle (OAO)**](../oao-onchain-ai-oracle/introduction/)
* [**Initial Model Offering (IMO)**](../imo-initial-model-offering/introduction.md)

### Architecture Overview

Initial Model Offering (IMO) incentivizes long-term and sustainable open-source contribution, by tokenizing ownership of open-source AI models. It allows funding for AI development, and rewards the community and open-source contributors. Token holders receive a portion of the revenue generated by onchain usage of the model.

Onchain AI Oracle (OAO) brings verifiable AI inference onchain. It empowers decentralized applications by providing trustless and permissionless use of AI. This opens up a variety of new use-cases, that weren't possible before. Use of Onchain AI Oracle implies a fee, which is later distributed to IMO token holders.

Together IMO and OAO are pushing the boundaries of open-source development.

### Benefits for Developers

Developers can utilize Onchain AI Oracle (OAO) to supercharge their smart contracts with AI. Key features of OAO include:

* All-in-one infrastructure with AI capability and automation
* Higher performance and shorter finality
* Run arbitrary program and any large ML model

### Advantages of ORA Oracle Network

ORA Oracle Network consists of node operators who run AI Oracle nodes to execute and secure computations with verifiable proofs. Some of the key advantages of oracle network include:

* Unstoppable autonomous protocol and network
* Optimal cryptography-native decentralization
* Verifiable, decentralized, and secure network
* Safeguarding the security of the base layer
* Efficient allocation of computing power
* 1-of-N trust model
