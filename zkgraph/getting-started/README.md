# Getting Started

### Pre-requisites

#### Required

* Basic knowledge on Ethereum smart contract development ([tutorials](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/tutorials/))
* Basic knowledge on Ethereum Architecture ([State Trie](https://medium.com/@eiki1212/ethereum-state-trie-architecture-explained-a30237009d4e)), Solidity Events (recommended readings [1](https://consensys.net/blog/developers/guide-to-events-and-logs-in-ethereum-smart-contracts/), [2](https://medium.com/mycrypto/understanding-event-logs-on-the-ethereum-blockchain-f4ae7ba50378), [3](https://thegraph.com/blog/event-driven-development-unlocking-optimized-dapps-and-subgraphs/), [4](https://mirror.xyz/spacesailor.eth/LEe2yoLoqy97BWHyO6J65XhnG8t33Nmvz\_Vsa3ve7rY)), Contract Storage (recommended reading [1](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.17/internals/layout\_in\_storage.html)), Ethereum Transaction ([Calldata](https://www.quicknode.com/guides/ethereum-development/transactions/ethereum-transaction-calldata), [Payload](https://oxpampam.hashnode.dev/ethereum-transaction-payload-explained), [Difference](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/127048/calldata-and-payload-for-multiple-calls))

#### Optional

* Subgraph development experience ([tutorial](https://thegraph.academy/developers/defining-a-subgraph/))
* AssemblyScript development experience ([book](https://www.assemblyscript.org/concepts.html))

### Methods for Development

For the development of a zkGraph, we offer two development methods:

1. [zkGraph Studio on Web UI](1.-zkgraph-studio-ui.md) (üê£ EXPERIENCE ONLY): Easy-to-use integrated web code editor and interface for experiencing zkGraph development for the first time.
2. [zkGraph Scaffold](2.-zkgraph-scaffold.md) (‚ú® RECOMMENDED): More customizable and end-to-end scaffold for zkGraph development.

### Examples

Example zkGraphs can be found as [templates of zkGraph scaffold](https://github.com/hyperoracle/zkgraph-cli/tree/main/packages/create-zkgraph/templates).
