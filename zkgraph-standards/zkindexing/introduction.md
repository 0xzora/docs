# Introduction

To utilize zkIndexing, developers need to utilize a zkGraph to define the indexing behaviors and querying schema.

Developers can build zkGraphs for zkIndexing from scratch, migrate them from existing subgraphs, or reuse deployed zkGraphs. For existing protocols like Uniswap, AAVE, or Curve, there are multiple open-source implementations available.

Once the zkGraph is deployed, the corresponding zkIndexing service will start indexing the blockchain, and the data will be queryable for any developer.
