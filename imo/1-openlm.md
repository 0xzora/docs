# #1: OpenLM

### **OpenLM** <a href="#heading-openlm" id="heading-openlm"></a>

#### Introduction <a href="#heading-introduction" id="heading-introduction"></a>

[OpenLM](https://github.com/mlfoundations/open\_lm) is a performative language modeling (LM) repository, aimed to facilitate research on medium sized LMs.

OpenLM is designed to maximize GPU utilization and training speed, and is easy to modify for new language model research and applications.

OpenLM is developed by researchers from various affiliations including the RAIVN Lab at the University of Washington, UWNLP, Toyota Research Institute, Columbia University, and more.

#### OpenLM, Open AI <a href="#heading-openlm-open-ai" id="heading-openlm-open-ai"></a>

Built upon principles of transparency and collaboration, OpenLM, as a fully open-source AI project, embodies the belief that innovation thrives in truly open ecosystems.

OpenLM is the truly open OpenAI.

By fostering decentralization and accessibility, OpenLM not only democratizes AI but also accelerates advancements in the field. OpenLM represents ORA's values that knowledge should be built in public, shared freely, and benefit communities globally.

### **IMO for OpenLM**

ORA introduces the world’s first initial model offering, tokenizing OpenLM with $OLM on Ethereum.

A portion of ORA's OpenLM IMO tokens will be allocated to OpenLM contributors, as a way to recognize and incentivize their commitment to and advancement of OpenLM's open-source ecosystem

**OpenLM Innovates LLMs as Open AI**

Currently, proprietary AI backed by substantial funding from entities like OpenAI, Google, Meta, etc., dominate the AI landscape, while open-source AI struggles to sustain development and innovation. To overcome the challenge, visionary support is crucial. IMO aims to address this gap by harnessing the power of Crypto and Blockchain to fund groundbreaking innovation, ensuring its openness and unleashing its full potential.

In our initial planning for IMO, countless AI models came to our attention, but OpenLM stands out for its unwavering commitment to open source and genuine decentralization—a feat unmatched by any other model. OpenLM epitomizes the future of AI: openness. It embodies the essence of Open AI, offering a truly accessible and decentralized way for delivering AI in a democratized way.

OpenLM was developed with the aim of advancing research on medium-sized language models (LMs). Currently, [in benchmarks](https://laion.ai/blog/open-lm/), OpenLM-1B surpasses many popular models of similar size, while OpenLM-7B matches or exceeds LLaMA-7B or MPT-7B on 7 out of 11 tasks. As a completely open-source platform, OpenLM exhibits outstanding performance. With ongoing support from additional resources, OpenLM holds the promise of evolving into an LM model collectively owned by the global community and adopted as the framework for all LMs—imagine the potential and possibilities for the future.

IMO will be the cornerstone of OpenLM's journey, providing crucial funding and incentives to nurture a sustainable ecosystem, democratize access, and propel continuous development. IMO for OpenLM is poised to revolutionize the landscape of Large Language Models with the power of open-source software and community. Join us on this transformative voyage, where innovation knows no bounds.
