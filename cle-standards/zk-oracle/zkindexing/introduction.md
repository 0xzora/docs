# Introduction

To utilize ZK Indexing, developers need to utilize a CLE to define the indexing behaviors and querying schema.

Developers can build CLEs for ZK Indexing from scratch, migrate them from existing subgraphs, or reuse deployed CLEs. For existing protocols like Uniswap, AAVE, or Curve, there are multiple open-source implementations available.

Once the CLE is deployed, the corresponding ZK Indexing service will start indexing the blockchain, and the data will be queryable for any developer.
