# AI Oracle

{% hint style="info" %}
If you want to build with onchain AI.

ORA offers:

* zkML of [keras2circom](https://github.com/ora-io/keras2circom) (the most battle-tested and performant zkML framework)
* [opML](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17555) of [AI Oracle](./) (run huge model like LlaMA2-7B and Stable Diffusion now)
* zk+opML with [opp/ai](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15006) (futuristic onchain AI fuses zkML's privacy and opML's scalability)
{% endhint %}

[AI Oracle (OAO)](https://blockworks.co/news/ora-on-chain-oracle-ethereum) is the ORA's verifiable and decentralized AI oracle.

CLE in AI Oracle, the different AI models in AI Oracle, defines the computation and model of ORA AI Oracle / opML nodes.

Smart contract developers can build their own contract based on different CLEs in AI Oracle, to integrate with OAO contract, so that they can use AI onchain.
