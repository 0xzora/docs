# 2. Frontend / Backend

Integrating with frontend or backend means you need to use the computation result offchain. For example, you want to access historical event data in frontend without using centralized and trusted archive node service.

When integrating with frontend or backend, you can use:

* **CLE-API Library:** API lib, written in TypeScript, contains essential calls for interacting with zkOracle. After deploying your CLE with Web IDE or Scaffold, you can use API lib in your project to call operations including executing CLE, generating proof of CLE compute, and verifying proofs. These are completely offchain, and do not require onchain operations.
* **zkIndexing (WIP)**

You can also check out this repo for example integration: [Game Of Life](https://github.com/Mingzhe-W/gameOfLife).
