# 1. Smart Contract

Integrating with smart contract means you need to use the computation result onchain inside a smart contract. For example: you want to access historical event data directly inside your smart contract in a trustless way.

When integrating with smart contract, you can use:

* [**ZK Automation**](../../cle-standards/zk-oracle/zkautomation/): A standard adopted by all ZK Oracle nodes. It will help you submit computation results and proofs (verified onchain by universal verifier smart contract). Requirements can be found under ZK Automation's user guide.
* **Prove Per Request (WIP):** Will fulfill your onchain compute and prove request by submitting the results and proofs async.
