# 2. CLE Scaffold

[CLE Scaffold](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-cle) contains all the SDK and some common AssemblyScript data structures needed for CLE development.

The scaffold will provide you information on the usage inside its README.

Previously, we offer CLE scaffold as [a template repo](https://github.com/ora-io/zkgraph/tree/b9fe1a6c2efd7e6a5793c47799da8745c1c748c4). It is now archived, and the usage of CLE Scaffold (create-cle) is recommended.
