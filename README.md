# About ORA

<img src=".gitbook/assets/Rainbow-Radiating-V1_00167-b.png" alt="" data-size="line">ORA is Ethereum's Trustless AI. ORA is the verifiable oracle protocol that brings AI and complex compute onchain.

Main product of ORA: **Onchain AI Oracle (OAO)**, brings AI onchain.

ORA breaks down the limitations of smart contracts by offering AI inference, so developers can innovate freely.

ORAâ€™s work has been trusted by Compound, Ethereum Foundation, Uniswap, Optimism, Arbitrum, and beyond.

#### Why ORA?

* **We build, they follow**: We are the last oracle for developers. We are the only oracle that has shipped an AI Oracle which is practical to use on Ethereum right now.
* **Onchain AI engine**: Our AI Oracle currently supports LlaMA 2 (7B) and Stable Diffusion. You can use and integrate them onchain directly. In the future, we will support any ML model.
* **Fast deployment**: We are coming to networks near you, including any network and any L2. You can build your own AI oracle that is programmable, permissionless, and censorship-resistant.
