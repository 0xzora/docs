<img src=".gitbook/assets/hoLogoNoBG.png" alt="" data-size="line">HyperOracle (Hyper Oracle) is a protocol and network for programmable [zero-knowledge oracle](https://ethresear.ch/t/defining-zkoracle-for-ethereum/15131) that preserves blockchain security and decentralization.

From indexing to smart contract automation, HyperOracleâ€™s zkGraph Standards make onchain data and onchain-equivalent computation useful and verifiable with fast finality. HyperOracle empowers developers to interact with blockchain in new ways.

Staking is the traditional, incentive-based security mechanism for oracles and other middleware infrastructure. HyperOracle replaces this incentive-based system with one based on zero-knowledge proofs (ZKP).
