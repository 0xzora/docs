Hyper Oracle is a programmable zkOracle network that safeguards blockchain security and decentralization.

From indexing to smart contract automation, Hyper Oracleâ€™s meta apps make on-chain data and off-chain computation useful and verifiable with fast finality. Hyper Oracle empowers developers to interact with blockchain in new ways.
