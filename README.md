# ðŸŒˆ Hyper Oracle

Hyper Oracle is a protocol and network for programmable zero-knowledge oracle that preserves blockchain security and decentralization.

From indexing to smart contract automation, Hyper Oracleâ€™s zkGraph Standards make onchain data and onchain-equivalent computation useful and verifiable with fast finality. Hyper Oracle empowers developers to interact with blockchain in new ways.

Staking is the traditional, incentive-based security mechanism for oracles and other middleware infrastructure. Hyper Oracle replaces this incentive-based system with one based on zero-knowledge proofs (ZKP).
