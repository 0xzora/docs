<img src=".gitbook/assets/hoLogoNoBG.png" alt="" data-size="line">Hyper Oracle is a programmable zkOracle network that safeguards blockchain security and decentralization.&#x20;

From indexing to smart contract automation, Hyper Oracleâ€™s meta apps make on-chain data and off-chain computation useful and verifiable with fast finality. Hyper Oracle empowers developers to interact with blockchain in new ways.

Hyper Oracle replaces traditional oracle and middleware infrastructure's security and incentive mechanisms from staking to ZKP.
